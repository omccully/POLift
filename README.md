# POLift

Mobile app created with C# with Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS. 
Uses MVVM architecture to improve code reusability between the Android and iOS versions to make the project easier to maintain. 
Interacts with a service and an SQL server hosted in Azure to provide a few cloud services to the app. 

POLift has many innovative features not commonly found in most workout apps: 

- Plate math: for barbell exercises, the app will display which plates to use based on the weight
- Rest timer: when submitting results for an exercise, a rest timer will automatically start. The timer length can be customized based on which exercise is being done.
- Progress graphs
- Warmup routine
- Tracks exercise weight and automatically increases weight over time based on user-defined rules
